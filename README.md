Simple Academic Portfolio — Preview

Files added under `simple_portfolio/`:

- `index.html` — Static HTML implementing a fixed left sidebar and main profile content.
- `styles.css` — Styles for layout, color scheme, and responsive behavior.

How to preview locally:

1. Open `simple_portfolio/index.html` directly in your browser (double-click), or run a simple local server from the repository root:

   python -m http.server 8000

   then open: http://localhost:8000/simple_portfolio/index.html

Notes and next steps:

- The site is static and uses inline SVG icons for contacts; update the hrefs to your real profiles.
- I used content from the existing project files for the sample copy. If you want, I can extract additional sections from `academic_cv.pdf` and add them.
